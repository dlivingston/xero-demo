# Xero Demo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Writeup

Built to the specifications in the codesandbox README. 

I used the css from the [Water.css](https://github.com/kognise/water.css) project to provide some clean default styling as well as 'dark' and 'light' theme based on the `prefers-color-scheme` media query.

I decided to use the `useState` React Hook to manage the form data. If I'd had more time I would have included some form validation and unit tests.

### `npm start`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
